        <p>Mechroneer was the first game I developed. It was my student capstone project. Mechroneer is a MOBA more similar to Battlerite than it is to bigger titles such as League of Legends, 
            unlike it's name however, it has nothing to do with mechs, but with robots. The game was made with Unity and I oversaw various aspects of the game such as the ability system, the UI
            stack, networking, and the overall architecture of the game. Download now at <a href="https://acsl.itch.io/mechroneer">Itch.io</a>

        <img src="WordMeetsTee.gif" width="640" height="360">
        <p>WordMeetsTee is a mobile game where scrabble meets golfing. Each turn you pick a club and gain letters to build as many words as possible to try and reach the hole. 
            Play solo or against other players either in real time or freely quit and come back later when your opponent has finally made a move. <br></br>
            WordMeetsTee was made in Unity and I was in charge of networking, microtransactions, cloud saving, UI, and various gameplay systems.

        <img src="ChessSoccer.gif" width="640" height="360">
        <p>Chess Soccer was developped for a game jam back in 2020. The name of the game is quite literal; using chess pieces to play soccer. This game was developped in a pair. I did all the programming
            while my partner did the art and sound effects. Download now at <a href="https://xerokimo.itch.io/chess-soccer">Itch.io</a>
